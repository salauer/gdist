\title{The general distribution function}
\usage{
pdist(dist, q, ..., arg_list, lookup_dist = F, lookup_verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{character string, specification of the distribution of interest using the abbreviations from \code{\link[stats]{distributions}}}

\item{q}{numeric vector of quantiles}

\item{...}{arguments specific to the distribution of interest (e.g. the "binom" distribution requires arguments for size and prob)}

\item{arg_list}{list, alternative to directly using the names of the arguments for the distribution of choice, the user can provide a list with those arguments enclosed. This is useful for when multiple distributions need to be drawn from.}

\item{lookup_dist}{logical, whether to look up the correctly abbreviated name}

\item{lookup_verbose}{logical, whether to print the abbreviated name found by lookup_dist}
}
\value{
a numeric vector representing the cumulative distribution function for the distribution of interest
}
\description{
The general distribution function
}
\examples{
## use curve and pdist to visualize the cumulative distribution for a function
curve(pdist("norm", x, 0, 1), from=-5, to=5)
}
